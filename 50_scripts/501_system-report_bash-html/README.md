# Bash Script to report some system usage in an html file

This is a simle bash script, made while reading The Linux Command Line, to store some system information in an html file, viewable in a browser.
It's quite simple, just to work a little on scripts and html, because I never learned the latter, until now.

(just execute the program and append `> report.html` to create the file, + `&& firefox report.html` after it if you want do open it instantly when finished).
