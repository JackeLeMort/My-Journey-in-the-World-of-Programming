# Welcome in my projects repo !

You'll find here my projects, weird tests and archives as I venture in the strange world of programming, developpement and computers.



## ressources I used :

- The Linux Command Line : https://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php  
    An amazing book by William Shotts that introduced me to Linux/GNU, command line, scripting and everything you need to know to start your journey with linux, I still use often.

- CS50 : https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/  
    A free online Harvard's Computer Science Course, it tought me what "programming" really is.
    
- Pro Git book : https://git-scm.com/book  
    I learned how to use git.
    
- And countless videos and tutorial online, impossible to reference them all, this section focuses on the major and important one, I however feel compeled to mention stackoverflow, and reddit where a lot of my questions where already answered by various community. 




# My story

This is intended as recruiters/teachers/colleagues who'd want to know more about me, as something I can look back to, I want to keep at least a trace of what I did and how, and maybe as a ressource for some people.

## 1. The beginning

Being born in 2002, I understand fairly easily most of the "new" technology, but programming isn't just understanding things that work, it's creating and solving things that don't.
