# CS50

TLCL introduced me to linux and computing, CS50 introduced me to programming, what it really is, how it works, and how I can do anything.

Those are just all the exercices I did with CS50, a part of them contain a custom library named `cs50.h` created by CS50's staff to start playing arround with C.
